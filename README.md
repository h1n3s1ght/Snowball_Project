My idea for this project would be to create an application that allows the user to calculate and plan how to pay their current debt.  This application would be using the “Snowball Method”.  The “snowball method,” simply put, means paying off the smallest of all your loans as quickly as possible. Once that debt is paid, you take the money you were putting toward that payment and roll it onto the next-smallest debt owed. Ideally, this process would continue until all accounts are paid off.
I have one for myself in an excel spreadsheet, but this could be a great source for many.
In the “Snowball” database, Users will first be the first Table created.   Upon accessing the website a user will be asked to create or sign in to a profile.  Users info will include- (Name, email, password, and Primary-ID).  In the next Table of Debt, They will be asked to add the total owed, debt provider name, billing date (monthly), percentage of interest rates, and current minimum payment.
The hope would be to create an easy dashboard that shows the user the total still owed, the monthly minimum payment (totaled), and the expected deadline to have things paid off.

Eventually this page will also give:

A make payments methods that will allow the user to make a payemnt toward a specific debt. without deleting the debt or manually changing the value of the debt after the payment.
